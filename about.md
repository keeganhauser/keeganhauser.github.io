Hi! I'm Keegan, and I'm a 21 y/o senior in college majoring in software engineering and minoring in applied math! I'll be graduating in June 2024, and hope to find some interesting work along the West Coast.

I decided to make a little blog/showcase to show off some of the things I've learned and created. I mostly work in C#, but also use other languages (to varying proficiencies) like C, C++, Python, and Rust. Most of my experience is certainly in C++ and C#. 

For the most case I tend to be interested in topics including game development, computer graphics, operating systems, and compilers. 

Here is a list of things I'm at least somewhat competent in:  
**Languages:**  
- C++
- C#
- C
- Python
- Rust
- Lua

**Libraries/Frameworks:**  
- Unity
- MonoGame
- Love2D
- SDL2
- Bevy
- WPF
- .NET Maui
- WinForms

**Other tools/technologies:**
- Git
- SQL (SQL Server and MySQL)
- MariaDB
- Visual Studio
- VS Code
- Various math/science Python libraries (numpy, scipy, pandas, etc.)
- WSL (Ubuntu)

If you have any comments or questions concerning me or anything I've worked on, feel free to email me: keegan.hauser.dev@gmail.com
