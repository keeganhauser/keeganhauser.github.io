Hi! I'm Keegan, and I'm 21 y/o and a senior in college majoring in software engineering and minoring in applied math! 

I decided to make a little blog/showcase to show off some of the things I've learned and created. I mostly work in C#, but also use other languages (to varying proficiencies) like C, C++, Python, and Rust. Most of my experience is certainly in C++ and C#. 

For the most case I tend to be interested in topics including game development, computer graphics, operating systems, and compilers.
