Hello!

I've continued working on adding some actually interesting information to this website. I've added the [Projects](https://keeganhauser.github.io/projects) tab in the header, and already has some of my projects listed! It is by no means an extensive list (at least as of now) and not nearly any of the links work since I haven't actually put these projects up on the web anywhere.

I'm hoping at some point I can learn how to showcase these projects with pictures and/or videos at some point. This whole web dev thing is hard!
