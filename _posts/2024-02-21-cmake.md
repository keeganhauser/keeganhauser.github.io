Hello!

I've been trying to learn how to use OpenGL on my Ubuntu machine and, boy, has it been quite a journey.
I was originally trying to use `make`, but it was a little too messy for me, so I decided to bite the bullet
and learn `cmake` instead. 

I followed a little tutorial to get GLFW working on my machine and eventually got it working. Now that I have
a working CMake build script, I think it makes a lot more sense than the original `make`. Like, this is all it
took for me to build my project so far:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.0.0)
project(ComputerGraphics VERSION 0.1.0)

cmake_policy(SET CMP0072 NEW)
find_package(OpenGL REQUIRED)

add_executable(ComputerGraphics src/main.cpp src/gl.h src/gl.c)

target_link_libraries(ComputerGraphics glfw OpenGL::GL)
```

With the code I have so far, this will build me an executable that produces a window filled with a lovely blue color:

![blue_background](/assets/images/blue_background.png)

Here's the code to do such:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include "gl.h"
#include <GLFW/glfw3.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    GLFWwindow *window;
    
    if(!glfwInit())
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);

    window = glfwCreateWindow(1080, 720, "Example", nullptr, nullptr);

    if (!window) {
        glfwTerminate();
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    glfwMakeContextCurrent(window);

    if (!gladLoadGL((GLADloadfunc)glfwGetProcAddress)) {
        std::cout << "Couldn't load opengl" << std::endl;
        glfwTerminate();
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    glClearColor(0.25f, 0.5f, 0.75f, 1.0f);

    while (!glfwWindowShouldClose(window)) {
        glfwPollEvents();

        glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);

        glfwSwapBuffers(window);
    }

    glfwDestroyWindow(window);

    glfwTerminate();
    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}

```
